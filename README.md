# Archetype
An easy solution for avatar services.

# API
You can view the API for Archtype [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/FoamFactory/Archetype/1.0.0)

# Installation
The easiest way to install archetype is from source through github:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:FoamFactory/archetype
```

# Setup
## From Source
Archetype is run via a [docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. As such, you're going to need docker engine and `docker-compose` installed. Installation instructions:
  - [Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  - [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Once you have docker installed, you will need to download this repository, edit `docker-compose.yml` to include the
host(s) which you wish to allow access to the avatar service _from_. This is a comma-separated list of IP addresses.
If you only want access to be available from the docker host machine, you can likely use the default. If this doesn't
work (you get errors saying that your host is not in the allowed list), you may need to run the following command on
your docker host to determine its in-network IP:
```bash
# Get the docker network up and running
docker-compose up -d

# Query to find your IP address. Place the result of this command into the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in docker-compose.yml
docker network inspect archetype_archetype_net -f '{{range .IPAM.Config}}{{.Gateway}}{{end}}'

# Bring the network down again
docker-compose down
```

Then, to get the service running, simply run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## From Docker Hub
You can also create your own `docker-compose.yml` file and have it download the appropriate images from Docker Hub. You
will likely want to create a `.env` file first, and populate the following values:
```bash
# This is the "mode" of operation, and is appended to the MySQL database name. It can be anything you choose, but
# likely something like "production", "staging", or "development".
ARCHETYPE_MODE=production

# The prefix of the name of the database. This is used with `ARCHETYPE_MODE` to create the database name. For example,
# if `ARCHTYPE_MODE=production` and `MYSQL_DATABASE=archetype`, then the final database name will be
# `archtype_production`.
MYSQL_DATABASE=archetype

# The name of the user on the MySQL host for accessing the database. This will be created automatically on the
# first run, so it doesn't need to already exist.
MYSQL_USER=archetype

# The password for the user on the MySQL host for accessing the database. This will be created automatically on the
# first run, so it doesn't need to already exist.
MYSQL_PASSWORD=somepassword

# The root password you want for the MySQL host. This does not need to already be set.
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
```

Once this is complete, write your `docker-compose.yml` file. A typical `docker-compose.yml` file looks something like:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  db:
    image: "mysql:5.7"
    container_name: archetype_db
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - archetype_net
    env_file:
      - .env.sample
    ports:
      # Use port 3307 on the host machine so as not to interfere with another mysql server already running
      # You can safely disable this if you don't want to access the MySQL container outside of archetype
      - "3307:3306"
    healthcheck:
      test: mysqladmin ping -h 127.0.0.1 -u $$MYSQL_USER --password=$$MYSQL_PASSWORD

  web_service:
    image: "jwir3/archetype_web:latest"
    env_file:
      - .env.sample
    environment:
      - ARCHETYPE_MODE
      - ARCHETYPE_ALLOWED_HOSTS=172\.([0-9]{1,3})\.([0-9]{1,3})\.([0-9]{1,3})
      - MYSQL_USER
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD
      - MYSQL_DATABASE="${MYSQL_DATABASE}_${ARCHETYPE_MODE}"
      - DB_URL="mysql://$MYSQL_USER:$MYSQL_PASSWORD@db/$MYSQL_DATABASE"
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    networks:
      - archetype_net
networks:
  archetype_net:
    driver: bridge
volumes:
  db_data:
```

# Installation and Maintenance Service
FoamFactory offers the following installation and maintenance services for archetype, so you don't even have to do the above:
- Install on one of our shared hosts, with maintenance: **$3/month** (billed annually)
- Install on a linode instance, **$150** (one-time), plus [linode fees](https://www.linode.com/pricing/)

If you're interested in having us perform the setup for you, please fill out the following [query form](https://forms.gle/FfJtdic2dz2md5bu8) and we'll respond as soon as possible.

# Building
If you want to build from source, you can clone this project from Github and follow these steps to build. You will need
docker installed and working (see above) to run the MySQL database. You will additionally need a Rust toolchain installed,
typically using `rustup`: [Installing Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). As of this writing, the minimum
`rustc` version required is `1.60.0-nightly`.

1.Start the MySQL database using docker (you may want to change the defaults in `.env`):
```bash
docker-compose up db
```
2. Specify your database connection url:
```bash
export DATABASE_URL=mysql://archetype:<password>@0.0.0.0:3307/archetype_production
```
3. Use `cargo` to build and run:
```bash
cargo run
```

# Docker Image Maintenance
This is a note for maintainers of the docker image [jwir3/archetype_web](https://hub.docker.com/r/jwir3/archetype_web/tags).
You probably don't need to worry about this.

In order to build the docker image, we need to set up a "dummy" `.env` file with some basic environment variables in it.
These can be overridden by the user when the download/run the image, but the build will fail without _something_ there.

**Note**: We should fix this so that it doesn't just _terminate the build_ if a `.env` file is not found.

Once you've made code changes that constitute the update(s) you want to make to the image in question, simply run the
command:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml --env-file <dummy_env_file or test env_file> up
```

Next, verify that the service is working as you expect (unless you built with a dummy `.env` file, in which case you
likely will not be able to check).

Next, tag the image for docker:
```

```
